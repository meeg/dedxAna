\maketitle

We assume that the number of events seen at a given mass and occupancy is described by 
(dimuon yield + coincidence rate * occupancy) * luminosity * efficiency

Each bin must be corrected for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Luminosity for this occupancy bin
\item Efficiency for this occupancy bin
\end{itemize}

\section{Luminosity correction}
