\maketitle

We assume that the number of events seen at a given mass and occupancy is described by 
(dimuon yield + coincidence rate * intensity) * luminosity * efficiency(intensity).

We use intensity binning (QIE.RF00) as opposed to occupancy binning because the occupancy distribution is skewed high for dimuon events, which may affect the calculation of efficiency.
Efficiency calculated from QIE is 

This assumes:

\begin{itemize}
\item Luminosity for this occupancy bin
\item Efficiency for this occupancy bin
\end{itemize}

Each bin must be corrected for:
\begin{itemize}
\item Luminosity for this intensity bin
\item Efficiency for this intensity bin
\end{itemize}
